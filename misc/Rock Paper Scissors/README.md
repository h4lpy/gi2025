# Rock Paper Scissors

My developer friend claims he has created an unbeatable game of rock-paper-scissors but he seems to be winning every time... Can you beat it?

Flag format: `flag{...}`

### How to Run

Launch `rock_paper_scissors.exe` from `cmd.exe`:

```

```

### Walkthrough

Running `strings` or carrying out static analysis will find a hidden `dynamite` command which results in the win condition
